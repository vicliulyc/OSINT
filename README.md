# Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Investigation Labs

## Overview
This repository contains a series of mini-labs designed to build practical skills in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) for information gathering and analysis. These labs utilize popular OSINT tools and techniques to collect, analyze, and visualize data from public sources, enhancing investigative capabilities in a cybersecurity context.

## Platform and Technologies Used
- **Tools**: Recon-ng, theHarvester, Maltego, Sherlock
- **Operating Systems**: Kali Linux, Virtual Machines
- **APIs and Databases**: SQLite
- **Search Engines**: Google, Firefox
- **Social Networks and Public Databases**: Various online social networks and public databases
- **Programming Language**: Python

## Labs Summary

1. **Lab 1: Recon-ng Setup and Target Data Gathering**
   - Configured and utilized **Recon-ng** to gather target information, including domain names, IP addresses, and social media profiles.
   - Explored Recon-ng modules to customize searches and optimize data collection.

2. **Lab 2: Data Harvesting with theHarvester**
   - Leveraged **theHarvester** to conduct efficient, multi-engine searches for target data.
   - Collected and managed data from a variety of public sources, enhancing scope and accuracy.

3. **Lab 3: Data Visualization with Maltego**
   - Configured **Maltego** to visualize data relationships collected in previous labs.
   - Created clear, structured visualizations to analyze target connections and relationship mappings.

4. **Lab 4: Social Media Username Search with Sherlock**
   - Used **Sherlock** to locate usernames across multiple social media platforms.
   - Developed skills in identifying and verifying digital identities across social spaces.

## Skills Developed
- **Data Analysis**: Interpreting and visualizing gathered data for insights.
- **Python Programming**: Scripting and data management with Python.
- **Network Security**: Understanding reconnaissance and its role in cybersecurity.
- **Databases**: Using SQLite for structured data storage and retrieval.
- **OSINT and Reconnaissance Techniques**: Leveraging public data sources for intelligence gathering.

## Getting Started
To replicate these labs:
1. Set up a **Kali Linux** environment (or virtual machine) with the necessary OSINT tools installed.
2. Follow the lab instructions to explore the functionality of each tool (Recon-ng, theHarvester, Maltego, Sherlock).
3. Practice gathering, analyzing, and visualizing data based on each labâ€™s objectives.
